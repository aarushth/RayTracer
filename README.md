This is a program that can render customizable spheres, triangles, and light sources in 3D space. You can define where the position of the camera is, where it is pointing, how far away the image is in 3D space, the position of as many spheres and triangles they want, their colors in RGB values, their reflectivity, the position of the lights, and even the light's colors.
